# Automated-Log-Synchronization-Script
This repository contains a lightweight yet powerful Bash script designed to automate the management and synchronization of application logs. The script was developed to solve a common operational challenge: ensuring local development and production logs are regularly processed for errors and securely backed up to a central server.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Automated Log Generation**  
  Simulates log file creation and organization using a `for` loop to generate realistic log data for testing.

- **Proactive Error Scanning**  
  Uses a `while` loop and pattern matching to efficiently scan log files and extract critical error messages, appending them to a dedicated error report.

- **Secure File Transfer**  
  Leverages `scp` to securely copy the generated error report to a remote server for archival and analysis.

- **Efficient Synchronization**  
  Employs `rsync` for reliable, one-way synchronization of the entire log directory, preserving file attributes and minimizing transfer overhead.

- **Regex-based Analysis**  
  Includes advanced `grep` commands with regular expressions to perform detailed analysis, such as counting specific types of errors with timestamps.
